                            <p>Companies have loads of data that include but aren’t limited to emails, files, etc. And with big data comes big risk. When a company is involved in a litigation, someone has to sort through all the data, which currently is very time consuming and costly. Previously, this process was extremely tedious, slow, and not transparent. The old process simply couldn’t evolve fast enough to the ever evolving problems at hand. <b>Our main goal was to minimize the amount of time and frustration that comes with processing data manually.</b> (make sure not Sam's)</p>

                        <span>UX + UI Designer</span><p>I joined the team at Release 3, so my role was to improve current designs and add elements that didn't make it into R1 or R2. These elements included but are not exclusive to user flows, lofi - midfi - hifi wires, and icon creation.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Solution</h3>
                        <span>Provide a workflow software for multi-sized businesses</span>
                            <p>StoredIQ for Legal is an end-to-end platform that streamlines eDiscovery lifecycle governance processes for legal stakeholders. <span class="callout">When an enterprise has been hit with a legal matter or internal investigation, they want to be confident they can surface relevant data quickly and have visibility during this entire process.</span> Our final deliverables consisted of user flows and hi fidelity wireframes that were acheived through collaboration with the development and offering management teams.<br><br></p>
